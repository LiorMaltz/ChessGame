# ChessGame
Trial project with the goal to improve my coding skills and especially my chess skills.

The app will feature an online chess game. Depend on my mood and my programming skills i will add some nice features and side user support

## Big pictures steps to make this chess app
1) Build the chess game (in offline mode)
2) Make it online
3) Add some nice side features like statistics, Training-Mode, etc.. 

## Steps for step 1 - The offline chess game idea
1) Build game/Match class, the class will hold two users sub class and will monitor the game
2) Build User class which will store the chess-peices objects, and each User class will store the state of the player which its represent
3) Will need to bring a lot of user interface (escpecially through the mouse). Will need to transfer the interface inputs to the game main class.
4) Ofcourse, design chess game graphic (will focus on 2d style)
